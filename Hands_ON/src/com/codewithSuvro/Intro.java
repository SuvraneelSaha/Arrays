        // everything was fine in variables why the hell do we need arrays

        // the reason is we cant store a large no. of data in variables
        // then we have to manually assign each var with a data or a value
        // this is not possible and very time consuming

        //Q : stor 500 roll nos
        // its not humanly possible to store 500 roll nos inside 500 variables
        // for each variable we have to assign a value to it
        // its not feasible

        // here comes the use of arrays

        // Q : What area arrays :
        // arrays is a collection of data types for storing data
        // it can be primitives complex data types
